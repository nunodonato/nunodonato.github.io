Hi I'm Nuno Donato!

This is my simple blog to jot down my thoughts related with many tec-related things.

I do programming, web development and game development as a freelancer. I also enjoy doing experiments and talking about 3D art, linux and opensource.

I'm creating this blog on github pages using Jekyll, so bear with me while I try to find time to tune it into a proper blog :)
